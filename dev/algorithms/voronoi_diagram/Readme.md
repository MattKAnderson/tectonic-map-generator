# Voronoi Diagram

This is the directory for development of code to produce voronoi diagrams.

# status

Fortunes Algorithm implemented for producing a voronoi diagram in O(log N) time. Runs in about 1ms for 1000 site locations.

# TODOs
## Features / bug fixes
1. clip to a smaller window
2. re-organize the code (put implementation details in another header)

## optimization opportunities
1. finish implementing the beach line tree as a red-black tree
